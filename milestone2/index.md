## Milestone 2: Definition & Related Work
In this milestone, we will clearly define the computing-related task/problem, identify existing solutions to that or similar tasks/problems,
propose a potential solution, and summarize that work in a recorded video presentation.

### Introduction:
Recent years have seen marked changes to the ways information, knowledge and communication are transduced through web-enabled technologies. With the proliferation of the Internet, the world is now interconnected on an enormous scale. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have ushered in a new kind of anywhere, anytime computing that opens up the potential for learning more readily situated in real-world contexts. Making sense of the vast changes that have occurred with the Internet and the ways we use it for learning both formally and informally remain a challenge.

Now let's see why collaborative learning matters. technologies with collaborative affordances can play in the development of skills in metacognition, planning, writing and creativity. In one higher education study, Wang, Ching-Huang, Yueh-Chiu, and Chun-Fu (2010, p. 444) found that, “through [web-enabled] social dialogue, students explored more ideas and constructed further knowledge” than in traditional writing and planning tasks, resulting in higher levels of “autonomous learning” and “self-confidence”. In the same study, the authors explored the extent to which online collaboration with Web 2.0 applications could enhance learning within the Cooperative Learning framework (Kagan & Kagan, 1994, p. 446), finding that the participants using Web 2.0 technologies scored higher in the areas of “content knowledge,”“group processing,”“social skills” and even “face-to-face interaction”. As evidenced thus far, this kind of collaboration implies much more than web-mediated interaction. Early Web 2.0 technologies enabled collaboration to an extent, with learners able to contribute ideas to online spaces, most often through “posting” or submitting text and/or media to prescribed content areas on a web page. Examples of collaboration with these technologies included ideas shared in a threaded discussion, section of a wiki or a comments board; once posted, other learners were then able to view and respond to posts in similar pre-defined areas of the web page when the content was refreshed (e.g. if the page is revisited at a later stage or is reloaded in the browser). Applications of these earlier Web 2.0 technologies to learning have led to research on the nature of collaboration as informed by modes of interactivity, including further analysis of synchronous and asynchronous interaction and the ways these modes are manifested between teachers, learners and content (Anderson & Elloumi 2004). Such research has presented, at various stages, cases for devising online activities that specifically incorporate both synchronous and asynchronous interaction in order to develop online collaboration skills as well as aligning specific applications with skills, curricula and other elements of the learning design (Burns, 2005; O’Reily, 2005; Prensky, 2005).

In other word, collaborative learning is when two or more people learn or attempt to learn something together.
Unlike individual learning, people engaged in collaborative learning. Capitalize on one another's resources and skills. More specifically, collaborative learning is based on the model that knowledge can be created within a population where members actively interact by sharing experiences and taking on asymmetric roles. Thus, collaborative learning is commonly  illustrated when groups of students work together, or students and their teacher work together to search for understanding, meaning, or solutions, create an artifact or product of their learning, or even write a code. Collaborative learning activities include collaborative writing, group
projects, joint problem solving, debates, study teams, and other activities. The approach is closely related to cooperative learning. 

The primary purpose of a live-coding session is to teach programming as a process. This approach helps students to understand the tasks and fully
techniques needed to write a fully working program after going through multiple iterations of thinking, designing, coding, and testing.
Therefore, collaborative learning can strongly affect student participation, performance, or engagement, which is not limited to students;
instructors are affected by this issue too. Because teaching performance has always been significant to instructors. 

While considering the importance of live coding, research shows that live coding:
1. It Makes the programming process easy to understand for novice programmers.
2. Helps students learn the process of debugging.
3. Exposes students to good programming practices.
4. Students prefer to code along with the instructor during a live-coding session rather than being mere observers.
 
Hence, this is important not only in online courses but also in in-person and thus hybrid classes. 

Live coding for cooperative learning without true collaboration can create code cramming without understanding.
Collaborative writing without history and log maintenance can cause a lack of transparency and poor engagement of collaborators.
